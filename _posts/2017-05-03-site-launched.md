Well. Finally I am putting my personal website following [post by Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be, all thanks to Jonathan McGlone. If you want one for self, go ahead and create one. Let's share what we know and make this world better place.
